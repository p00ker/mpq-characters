Juggernaut is one of the fundamental characters of starting play, and the opposition voted "most likely to spam cheap powers that hurt" during Dark Avengers-heavy Story events.

New player note: you want to keep exactly one 1* character for Deadpool daily quests. Juggernaut is advised to due his incredible speed at this job, although [Iron Man (Model 35)]({% link _characters/1/ironman.md %}) and [Spider-man (Original)]({% link _characters/1/spiderman.md %}) can also do reasonably at this task.

{% include ap.html color='green' %} Unstoppable Crash destroys 16 tiles for the low price of 6 AP. This will not give AP, but does damage, and will usually cause cascades.

At 6 AP {% include ap.html color='red' %} Headbutt does a huge amount of damage and hurts yourself, but you don't care because you aren't going to use a 1* for more than one fight a day after you get into 2* land.
